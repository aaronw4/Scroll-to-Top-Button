#### Adjusting the Component
* **When the scroll button appears** is determined in lines 9 and 11. The higher the number then the farther down the page the user must scroll before the button appears.
* **How it scrolls** is determined in line 17. The behavior can be switched to 'auto' if you prefer an instant return to the top of the page.
* **The type of font** can be found on line 23. This is an arrow that points to the right. The CSS rotates it so that if points up.
